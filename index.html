    <h3>Chennai</h3>
    <p>Among the places that I had visited, I felt <b>Chennai</b> as the best place to live despite of its <b>hot</b>   weather conditions. The lifestyle of people living there is a mixture of multiple cultures that vary from deep rooted Indian culture to growing western culture.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.techhouse.org/~mdp/midpoint/oriented1.php">There are formulas for the area of a triangle in terms of the coordinates of the vertices that automatically give the algebraic area. For example, to find the algebraic area of a triangle with first vertex at (0, 0), second vertex at (a, b) and third vertex at (c, d), we may use the formula (1/2)(ad - bc). This will be positive if the slope d/c of the line from (0, 0) through (c, d) is greater than the slope b/a of the line from (0, 0) through (a, b), since d/c > b/a implies that ad > bc and ad - bc > 0. In terms of vectors, if the line along (a, b) rotates in a counterclockwise direction to get to the line along (c, d), then the triangle from (0, 0) to (a, b) to (c, d) has positive area, 
    and if it rotates in a clockwise direction, the algebraic area of the triangle is negative.<a href = "https://www.techhouse.org/~mdp/midpoint/oriented1.php">Source Link</a>
